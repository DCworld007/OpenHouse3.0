# Error Log - Cloudflare Deployment Issues

## Initial Issues

1. Missing `generateStaticParams()` for dynamic routes
   - Error: Page "/planning-room/[groupId]" cannot be used with "output: export"
   - Fix: Added `generateStaticParams()` to dynamic route pages
   - Status: ✅ Fixed

2. Client/Server Component Mixing
   - Error: ReactServerComponentsError in planning room
   - Fix: Split into server/client components
   - Status: ✅ Fixed

3. Browser API Access During Build
   - Error: "self is not defined" in various components
   - Fix Attempts:
     a. Added webpack fallbacks for browser APIs
     b. Created separate client components
     c. Simplified map component
   - Status: ❌ Still occurring

4. Edge Runtime Conflicts
   - Error: Edge runtime disabling static generation
   - Fix: Removed edge runtime directives
   - Status: ✅ Fixed

## Attempted Solutions

1. Static Export Approach
   ```js
   // Initial next.config.js
   output: 'export'
   ```
   - Result: Failed due to browser API conflicts

2. Cloudflare Adapter Approach
   ```bash
   npm install @cloudflare/next-on-pages
   ```
   - Result: Still encountering "self is not defined"

3. Map Component Simplification
   - Created `SimpleMap.tsx` to replace `LeafletMap.tsx`
   - Removed client-side dependencies
   - Result: Issue persists

4. Webpack Configuration
   ```js
   if (isServer) {
     config.resolve.fallback = {
       canvas: false,
       'mapbox-gl': false,
       'leaflet': false,
       // ...
     };
   }
   ```
   - Result: Did not resolve "self is not defined"

## Latest Findings (Update)

After attempting to switch to server-side rendering, we've identified that the core issue lies with Clerk's authentication components:

1. The "self is not defined" error persists in auth routes even after:
   - Removing static export
   - Switching to server-side rendering
   - Updating deployment configuration

2. Key Observation:
   - Error consistently occurs in auth-related routes
   - Clerk components may be incompatible with Cloudflare Pages' build process
   - Issue appears to be independent of our rendering strategy

## Recommended Solutions

1. Short-term:
   - Consider using Clerk's standalone components instead of the Next.js integration
   - Implement a custom auth solution using Clerk's API directly
   - Use environment-aware imports for Clerk components

2. Long-term:
   - Evaluate alternative auth providers that are known to work with Cloudflare Pages
   - Consider implementing a custom auth solution
   - Work with Clerk support to identify a compatible setup

## Next Steps

1. Investigate Clerk's compatibility with Cloudflare Pages specifically
2. Test with Clerk's standalone components
3. Consider implementing a temporary alternative auth solution while waiting for better Clerk/Cloudflare compatibility

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue appears to be that Clerk's Next.js components are trying to access browser APIs during the build process, which fails in Cloudflare's build environment. This suggests that the components are not properly configured for server-side rendering or static generation in the Cloudflare environment.

## Current State

Still encountering "self is not defined" error during build, specifically in:
1. `/auth/login`
2. `/auth/signup`
3. `/plan/[groupId]`

## Analysis

### Common Themes
1. Browser API usage during build time
2. Client/Server component boundary issues
3. Static generation conflicts with dynamic features

### Potential Root Causes
1. Clerk authentication components may be using browser APIs during build
2. Map components still trying to access browser APIs despite simplification
3. Next.js static export may be incompatible with some of our dynamic features

### Next Steps
1. Review Clerk documentation for static export compatibility
2. Consider server-side rendering approach instead of static export
3. Investigate alternative deployment strategies for Cloudflare Pages
